key encrypted LSB steganography PNG album filesystem in userspace

Create, access, or modify a steganographic filesystem in userspace using a directory of PNG images.  Filesystem state is only preserved after safely closing the filesystem via unmount or Ctrl+C.  A filesystem may only use images with the same dimensions as the root image provided.
A filesystem requires a name, key, root image, and storage images.  To access a filesystem the correct key, filesystem name, and root image must be given.  All data is XOR'd with the key as it is read and written from the images.  The root image stores the filesystem name, consumed and total space, image and file count, image filenames, and file meta data.  All images added to the filesystem while formatting or expanding are found in the same directory as the root image.

DEPENDENCIES:
	- fuse
	- libpng


COMPILE:
	- make all
	- sudo make install
	- make clean


KNOWN BUGS:
	- Filesystem cannot survive image renames


COMMANDS:
       -format [drivename]
              create a new filesystem using valid images in directory of root image provided and mount it.

       -expand [drivename]
              expand  and mount an existing filesystem. The directory containing the root image is scanned for addi‚Äê
              tional valid PNG images not already included in the filesystem.

       -mount [drivename]
              mount an existing filesystem

       -debug enable bit by bit debug output. IO blocking from this output will cause the filesystem to operate very
              slowly.

       -help  echo command syntax and exit program.


EXAMPLES:
       albumfs -format mydrive images/vacation/image.png

       albumfs -debug -mount mydrive images/vacation/image.png


TODO:
	- Replace use of name for image tracking with sum
